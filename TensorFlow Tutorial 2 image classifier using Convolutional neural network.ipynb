    "To demonstrate how to build a convolutional neural network based image classifier, we shall build a 6 layer neural network that will identify and separate images of dogs from that of cats. This network that we shall build is a very small network that you can run on a CPU as well. Traditional neural networks that are very good at doing image classification have many more paramters and take a lot of time if trained on CPU. However, in this post, my objective is to show you how to build a real-world convolutional neural network using Tensorflow rather than participating in ILSVRC. Before we start with Tensorflow tutorial, let’s cover basics of convolutional neural network. If you are already familiar with conv-nets(and call them conv-nets), you can move to part-2 i.e. Tensorflow tutorial."

A neuron takes an input(say x), do some computation on it(say: multiply it with a variable w and adds another variable b ) to produce a value (say; z= wx+b). This value is passed to a non-linear function called activation function(f) to produce the final output(activation) of a neuron. There are many kinds of activation functions.

Designing the architecture is slightly complicated and advanced topic and takes a lot of research. There are many standard architectures which work great for many standard problems. Examples being AlexNet, GoogleNet, InceptionResnet, VGG etc. In the beginning, you should only use the standard network architectures. You could start designing networks after you get a lot of experience with neural nets. Hence, let’s not worry about it now.\n",

    "Correct weights/parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have decided the architecture of the network; the second biggest variable is the weights(w) and biases(b) or the parameters of the network. The objective of the training is to get the best possible values of the all these parameters which solve the problem reliably. For example, when we are trying to build the classifier between dog and cat, we are looking to find parameters such that output layer gives out probability of dog as 1(or at least higher than cat) for all images of dogs and probability of cat as 1((or at least higher than dog) for all images of cats.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the best set of parameters using a process called Backward propagation, i.e. you start with a random set of parameters and keep changing these weights such that for every training image we get the correct output. There are many optimizer methods to change the weights that are mathematically quick in finding the correct weights. GradientDescent is one such method(Backward propagation and optimizer methods to change the gradient is a very complicated topic. But we don’t need to worry about it now as Tensorflow takes care of it).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let’s say, we start with some initial values of parameters and feed 1 training image(in reality multiple images are fed together) of dog and we calculate the output of the network as 0.1 for it being a dog and 0.9 of it being a cat. Now, we do backward propagation to slowly change the parameters such that the probability of this image being a dog increases in the next iteration. There is a variable that is used to govern how fast do we change the parameters of the network during training, it’s called learning rate.  If you think about it, we want to maximise the total correct classifications by the network i.e. we care for the whole training set; we want to make these changes such that the number of correct classifications by the network increases. So we define a single number called cost which indicates if the training is going in the right direction. Typically cost is defined in such a way that; as the cost is reduced, the accuracy of the network increases. So, we keep an eye on the cost and we keep doing many iterations of forward and backward propagations(10s of thousands sometimes) till cost stops decreasing. There are many ways to define cost. One of the simple one is mean root square cost. Let’s say yprediction is the vector containing the output of the network for all the training images and yactual is the vector containing actual values(also called ground truth) of these labeled images. So, if we minimize the distance between these two variables, it would be a good indicator of the training. So, we define the cost as the average of these distances for all the images:\n",
    "\n",
    "cost=0.5∑i=0n(yactual−yprediction)2\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simple example of cost, but in actual training, we use much more complicated cost measures, like cross-entropy cost. But Tensorflow implements many of these costs so we don’t need to worry about the details of these costs at this point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training is done, these parameters and architecture will be saved in a binary file(called model). In production set-up when we get a new image of dog/cat to classify, we load this model in the same network architecture and calculate the probability of the new image being a cat/dog. This is called inference or prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For computational simplicity, not all training data is fed to the network at once. Rather, let’s say we have total 1600 images, we divide them in small batches say of size 16 or 32 called batch-size. Hence, it will take 100 or 50 rounds(iterations) for complete data to be used for training. This is called one epoch, i.e. in one epoch the networks sees all the training images once. There are a few more things that are done to improve accuracy but let’s not worry about everything at once."

After convolutional layers, we flatten the output and add two fully connected layer in the end.
